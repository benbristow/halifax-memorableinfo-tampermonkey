Halifax Memorable Information Tampermonkey Script
======================================================

Tampermonkey Script that autofill's Halifax Online Banking's annoying 'Memorable Information' dropdown boxes.

Probably works on Firefox's GreaseMonkey addon as well, and with a few tweaks probably works on Lloyd/TSB's online
banking as well since they're the same banking group.
